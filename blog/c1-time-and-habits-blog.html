    <h1>Reflection on time and habits learning</h1>
    <h2>"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you caught up in circles confusion is nothing new"<em> Cyndi Lauper</em></h2>

    <p>There's not much I can say about the time and habits thing at the moment. I have been running around waffles, githubs, atoms and bashes like a fried chicken. I wanted all the fried chicken and all the snacks each time I went to do an assignment.</p>
    <p>Here are some time and habits strategies I kind of tried and/or want to try next week:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Timeboxing - I tried allocating time to set assignment tasks, but still found myself spending way too much time on one item. Next week I will use an alarm to signal the end of a box of time.</li>
        <li>Pomodoro - I didn't figure this one out until later on in the assigments list. The 25-minute cycles may help pull me out of any over extended reading and/or 'rabbit holes'. </li>
        <li>Little habits - Although doing two push ups each time I flush a toilet is not my jam, compiling a list of great small habits is a great idea.</li>
        <li>Meditation - I've downloaded the Headspace app to help keep me on track with creating a new meditation habit. Committing to 10-minutes each morning is a do-able habit to add to the mix of 'I am awesome' behaviours.</li>
      </ul>
