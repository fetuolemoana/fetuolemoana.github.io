                <h2>Identity values and strengths exploration</h2>
                <h3>Conversation with friends</h3>
                <p>
                  I was on holiday in Niuē and relax-talking with a couple of friends about life. They gave me pause to reflect on my self-perception when they told me that I was a genuinely nice person.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My internal responses to this assessment of my character were brief reluctance, shame at all the times I had been unkind that week, attempted positive absorption, and thinking of ways that my friends were also kind.  
                </p>        
                <h3>Conversation with facilitator</h3>
                <p>
                  During a DEV Academy check-in, my facilitator shared some impactful insight that helped me to re-frame some of my thinking. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  She shared that she is easily driven to take action to get work done in a collective setting. However, the flow can be different when it's a project that appears to only be of her. I can't remember her exact words; something to do with recognising and taking action for yourself as a worthy project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was powerful sharing from her and it sparked in me a realisation that I often de-prioritise my 'self' as a project. Our discussion gave me the impression that admirably, she puts work into personal growth and that the ongoing project of self-development and self-awareness is important. During our discussion, my facilitator commented that some of my ideas were 'visionary' - that was kind.
                </p>
                <h3>Time with family</h3>
                <p>
                  I spent a weekend in Wellington for my cousin's 21st birthday. The last time we had all gathered together was for my cousin's funeral in May of this year. This year for Christmas, some of us will be in Sāmoa for my uncle's unveiling. 
                <p>
                  It has been a devastating time for my family, and I am particularly sad for my late cousin's children, parents, siblings and aunties and uncles. Given the cloudy context of sadness hovering around our family, I decided that it was important to go to Wellington and celebrate my younger cousin's birthday and spend time with my family in Newtown. During his birthday celebration, my cousin said that I was an influence in his love of hip-hop - I am so proud of him. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Wellington I ugly-cried with joy, pride and relief at my cousin's alcohol-free 21st earthday and when I had to return to Auckland, I ugly-cried with joy and sadness at the airport. The oceans of love I hold of my family tell me that they are important to me.  
                </p>
                <h3>Ethics as a conversation of love and authenticity</h3>
                <p>
                  We engage with ethics when we ask questions of ourselves and the actions we choose. The brief conversations I mentioned before are brief illustrations of me in relation to how others might perceive me to be. They show that I value kindness, the collective, learning, family, and hip-hop.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lately I have been asking less of 'what is the right thing to do' and more of 'what is the me to do'. This is partly to do with a growth process of recognising and letting go of my internal shame dynamics. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a child growing up in a Catholic family, I would often advise myself to behave as though God was watching (perhaps a less trendy variation of WWJD?). I chuckle to myself now because the way my thinking and feeling has oriented itself now is towards a knowing that (a) gods are watching (b) this includes your ancestors (c) yes they are even watching when you are having sex and / or going to the toilet. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your ancestors are watching your actions, thoughts and feelings so you might as well 'do you boo' without being an egg to yourself and others. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Currently, as an individual, I try not to make right or wrong decisions. I try to make real decisions because I am actively working to trust the voice(s) of my gods and ancestors above, below and within. In a wider collective / family context, I don't believe I have the answers, but I do trust that somewhere swimming in the relational space of those who are authentically engaged, and who are working at trusting the voice(s) of their gods and ancestors, are the ways forward. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  A culture of Samoan relational ethics is threaded through almost all decisions and actions I choose in life. The most powerful thing for me living for ways beyond the freedom-killing colonisations, internal and external homophobias and racisms, is offering myself the moment to pause and recognise the choices that I do have, and making them.
