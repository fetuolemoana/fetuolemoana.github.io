          <h6>Responsiveness</h6>
            <p>
              A responsive site's content is flexible and adjustable so that content can be displayed on any screen size and type. This allows users to access the information they need efficiently.
            </p>
          <h6>Mobile first design</h6>
            <p>
              Mobile first design describes a website that considers hierarchy by prioritising designing for the mobile device (small screen) user first. This means that mobiles don't have to process the rules made for desktop as well as mobile rules in order to display site content.
            </p>
          <h6>Frameworks</h6>
            <p>
              Frameworks in the web realm, are an idea of or an articulated bundle of things (structure of files, standardised code etc) that make up and support the building of a website.
            </p>
            <p>
              A three-layer understanding of the website development eco-system can be described as consisting of (i) presentation / front-end; (ii) application / back-end; (iii) data / databases.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the front-end layer, the grid system (a way of arranging content on a page) can be described as a framework that helps us to build sites. At the back-end, frameworks can include Symfony, Django and Ruby on Rails.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frameworks support common structures and help us to avoid 'reinventing the wheel' because they provide a standardised idea of how we should / could / build things. The pros include efficiency, speed (and cost) security and larger communities of support. However, some of the cons include being at risk of having a shallow understanding of the language behind a framework, and being restrained by a framework's set limits may inhibit your work.
            </p>
          <h6>Wireframes</h6>
            <p>
              A wireframe is a basic visual representation of elements on a website. Wireframes help to establish hierarchy of information on a page, simplify communication with stakeholders and create a blueprint for the designer to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
              The navigation bar and arrangement of images on the home page was a challenge. On top of that, I am still trying to wrap my head around using responsive design features for mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't follow my blueprint as I did not complete the assignments to time and am behind. I wish I had taken advice not to use a wireframe programme to create my wireframes because it took up time I could have used for furthering my understanding of responsive design.
            </p>
