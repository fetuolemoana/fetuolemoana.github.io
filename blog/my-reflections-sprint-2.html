    <h2>primer and setup</h2>
    <h3>9 november 2018</h3>
    
    <p>
      The sprint rua primer and setup competencies are:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>understand the purpose of your blog</li>
    <li>add a blog directory with template HTML</li>
    <li>and link your css file to your HTML file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The purpose of my blog is to express what I am learning at Dev Academy. 
      Setting up the blog directory, blog template html and linking a css file are tasks that I am familiar with from my Phase-0 learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting up the blog directory is creating an area / folder where all blog pages for the website can be stored. In the terminal you would do this by going to where your website is on your computer:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>mkdir blog command to create the blog folder</li>
    <li>cd blog command to move into the new blog folder</li>
    <li>use the touch command to create a new html file within the blog folder</li>
    <li>to open the new file in your default code editor, type code .</li>
    <li>insert template text for your blog</li>
    <li>and then save, stage, commit and push the new stuff from your computer to online land.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Just like creating the blog folder and html file, the next steps are to create a styles folder using mkdir and a new css file using the touch command. To link the html and css files, you add instructions in the html file telling it where to grab its styles from.
    </p>
    <h2>wood and waka</h2>
    <h3>11 november 2018</h3>
    <p>HTML is to CSS, what wood is to waka, vaka, va'a. The wood (inclusive of sinnet / gafa) is the material content and the carving into waka, vaka, va'a is the style applied. Without the wood and sinnet, there is no waka, and without the waka, we are left with just a body of wood and unbraided sinnet.</p>
    <p>The obstacles I encountered was navigating the learning material and blog I have already created in a Foundations context. I overcame it by making a decision not to start from scratch, but to try and incorporate what I have already done in Phase-0 into my current learning journey.</p>
    <p>It was a pleasure to do the Udacity course and recognise concepts that I had come across and practiced while doing HTML and CSS lessons in Free Code Camp.</p>
