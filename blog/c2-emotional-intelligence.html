    <h1>Search Inside Yourself I</h1>
    <p>
      The first chapter of Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan offered insight about mindfulness and emotional intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mindfulness is defined as 'moment to moment non-judgemental awareness' and/or 'bicep curls for the brain'.
    </p>
    <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as a 'collection of emotional skills'.</p>
    <p>
      Of particular importance is Chade-Meng's assertion that EI is trainable via:
      <ul>
        <li>attention training e.g. 2 minutes of mindfulness</li>
        <li>self-knowledge and mastery e.g understanding the differences between existential, experiential and physiological selfhood </li>
        <li>creating useful mental habits e.g wishing happiness for each person you meet.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I have been practicing meditation and mindfulness since the beginning of the course and I believe it has gradually improved my ability to be present with dev tasks and loved ones. I plan to continue doing my brain bicep curls!</p>
