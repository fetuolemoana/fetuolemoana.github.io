        <h2>Problem solving</h2>
        <h3>Getting blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p>
          Reading and understanding the question is key to problem solving. There are many instances during my learning where I have not understood the question or read it properly. A problem called 'Super FizzBuzz' had me stumped from go for a while. The first instruction was to write a method that would take an array of whole numbers. Instead of looking at the coding example properly, I assumed that the method would take a set of numbers and turn them into an array first. This introduced a level of complexity that I was not prepared for. However, the instruction was that the method would TAKE an array, not CREATE an array. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After many frustrating attempts to 'try something', I returned to the FizzBuzz (Super Edition) instructions page; I saw that the example code showed the array should be taken as the stuff that goes within the parentheses next to the function name (parameter) e.g. super_fizzbuzz([1,2,3]) not super_fizzbuzz(1,2,3). Recognising that I had read the question wrong, made me slow down and reassess my problem solving process in more depth. 
        </p>
        <h3>Solving a problem in an elegant way</h3>
        <p>
          My attempts at solving Super FizzBuzz were clumsy in the beginning, but after reassessing my problem solving process and having a breather, I found some elegance in my pseudocode use. Pseudocode can be described as plain language steps of what you want your code to do. To begin with, my psuedocode was too broad, but once I reduced the problem into smaller steps, the solution became more manageable. The smaller plain language steps, made it easier to understand what I needed to research more of. 
        </p>
        <h3>Problem solving techniques and process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode - plain language steps by step comments for what you want your code to do. This is an effective way to break a solution into smaller steps. I feel confident that the more practice I get using this technique, the more effective it will become. Reducing the problem into smaller chunks is also a great way to come up with solutions for problems outside of code too!</li>
          <li>Trying something - try something, and if it's not working, try something else. I think all these methods are a way of trying something. Coupled with another problem solving technique and a growth mindset focused on process and effort, 'trying something' is a solid technique.</li>
          <li>Rubber ducky method - this method involved using a rubber ducky or other inanimate object as a pretend friend to explain your problem in plain language to. I have a Vault Tec perception bobblehead as my rubber ducky when I want to channel my inner palagi man to help solve my coding problems.</li>
          <li>Error messages - reading error messages when things don't work is a great way to help work out where code might be going wrong. In terms of my own problem solving practice, I will need to spend more time learning what the error messages mean.</li>
          <li>Console logging - the console.log() statement is commonly used to debug JavaScript. Issues with this include a lack of context because often we don't even know what the problem is let alone what we should try and console.log().</li>
          <li>Google - searching the Internet for information to help support my learning is critical to my independent problem solving process.</li>
          <li>Asking coaches and peers for help - asking coaches or peers for help can illuminate a solution to a problem from a different perspective. This process also helps me feel less isolated in my work.</li>
          <li>Reflection - taking the time to reflect on my problem solving process has helped create some breathing space around my learning journey. The way that Foundations requires you reflect as you go also helps because reflections are threaded throughout the learning experience and not just at the end of a sprint.</li>
