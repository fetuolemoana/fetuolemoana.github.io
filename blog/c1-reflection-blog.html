    <h1>Quick reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat - Kitchen v Table</h1>
    <h2>"We woke up in the kitchen saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"<em> Beyonce</em></h2>

    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>I appreciate people that expect to work in the kitchen together. I also appreciate people that know how to rinse and wash dishes. I've heard that if you are not at the table, you're on the menu. I don't want to be on the menu and often I don't like society's tables. The creator mindset presents the kitchen as an option and I feel that perspective is where I'm at.</p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>Shereef Bishay's ideas about learning are skuxx. I think the values they share are harmonious with vƒÅ, a relativity and interconnectivity theory indigenous to Oceania.</p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>I have no 'hustle' when it comes to a competitive mindset. I feel like what Bishay said about a moldy competitive mindset not being able to thrive when you allow yourself to be vulnerable and expose your ignorance, is on point. Collective growth that nurtures feedback and accountability is exciting to me and I feel that I will thrive in a "team sport" environment. My experience of being in an actual kitchen is about family working together and that's how I hope to be working with my fellow cohortians.</p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>So far, everything in this video reiterated the kaupapa described on the <a href="https://www.devacademy.co.nz">EDA website.</a></p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>Yes I am excited and nervous. I am afraid that when I show up EDA peoples will be like 'jokes we're actual racist and homophobic'... Anyway, I'm glad we will get a long lunch break re kitchen v table and me over-extending the metaphor because I'm hungry. </p>
