          <h6>How does JS compare to HTML and CSS?</h6>
            <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are computer languages that help us build websites. HTML is used to define the actual content of the page, CSS is used to define design and layout of websites (i.e. what they look like) and JavaScript allows us to tell the website how to behave and interact with visitors and can also help us store information about and for visitors through features like forms. </p>
          <h6>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h6>
            <p>Control flow describes the order that the computer does what you tell it to do (via your code as the set of instructions). </p>
            <p>By default the computer follows instructions line by line from top to bottom. However, certain instructions such as looping statements (for, while and do-while) often require a break up in the top down flow.</p>
            <p>Wiping your bottom after doing a poo can be used as an everyday life process comparable to control flow and looping.</p>
            <p>The top down control flow is:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>sit down</li>
              <li>do a poo</li>
              <li>wipe your bottom</li>
              <li>flush the toilet.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>But wait a minute, what if your first wipe doesn't get rid of all the poo? Steps (3) and (4) present a great opportunity to insert a poo loop that would instruct you to wipe your bottom again while poo !== 0. </p>

          <h6>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h6>
            <p>Objects are variables that can contain multiple things (values, properties, methods). You can get to the stuff inside objects by using the name of the property or method in the following way:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>objectName.propertyName</li>
              <li>objectName["propertyName"]</li>
              <li>objectName.methodName()</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Similarly arrays can store multiple things (elements) under a single label (varible). However, elements are accessed by using an automatically assigned index number (starting from 0) e.g. [0], [1], [2].</p>
          <h6>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h6>
            <p>A function can be described as a set of instructions or a customised JavaScript command created to carry out a particular action. </p>
            <p>Functions are awesome because they can be defined once and reused many times; this helps us to avoid being DRY and repeating ourselves again and again and again. </p>
