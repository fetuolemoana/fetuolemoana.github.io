            <h2>Emotional intelligence</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence (EQ) is an active and ethical awareness of your feelings and emotions as well as others'. By active and ethical, I refer to the actual use of EQ to inform how you guide and take responsibility for your thinking and activities in relation to this awareness. For me, emotional intelligence is ideally a form of 'collective mindfulness'.  
            </p>
            <p>
              IQ stands for intelligence quotient and can be measured by a score taken from tests to assess a rigid and old-school measure of logic and externally (rather than internal) analytical 'intelligence'. 
            </p>
              Emotional intelligence is important for creative, dynamic and collective approaches to learning and development. As an individual, EQ allows you to take responsiblity for your internal growth and collectively, you will enhance your relationships with your communities. Your measure of success will not be based on static tests, but will be based on the ever-changing world around you. 
            <p>
            <p>
              We are not individual islands isolated by IQ, we are connected by oceans of relationships bravely navigated by a dynamic view of EQ.
