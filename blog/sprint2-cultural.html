            <h2>Dynamic learning agreement</h2>
            <p>
              A responsibility to family and community is what motivates me to take action. The frame of an individual desire to learn and develop self can get in the way because sometimes I have to navigate internalised hate and feel like I don't deserve to become a better person.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to succeed, I have to take action and believe that I am a worthy project and that this project of self-awareness and alofa will help me serve my collective responsibility to our ancestors past, here and yet to come. 
            </p>

            <h3>Coconut learning tracker</h3>
            <p>
              Maintain accocountability and coconnectivity with my facilitator by sending them a coconut emoji or picture for each day I meet my scheduled learning time goal for that day.
            </p>
            <h3>Foundations fellowship and responsiveness</h3>
            <p>
              I can't engage in helping my foundations whanau during my Auckland Council work schedule. However, I want to make an effort to show-up for my crew during my Dev Academy work schedule times, but I'm not sure how to make this a measurable goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              My conduct towards my fellow Foundations and wider DEV Academy crew will be respectful and friendly and honour my core Samoan relationship ethics. I will aim to behave in ways that communicate 'the ancestors within and beyond me recognise the ancestors within and beyond you'.
            </p>
