            <h2>Dynamic learning agreement</h2>
            <p>
              A responsibility to family and community is what motivates me to take action. The frame of an individual desire to learn and develop self can get in the way because sometimes I have to navigate internalised hate and feel like I don't deserve to become a better person.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to succeed, I have to take action and believe that I am a worthy project and that this project of self-awareness and alofa will help me serve my collective responsibility to our ancestors past, here and yet to come. 
            </p>
            <h3>Schedule and block-outs</h3>
            <p>
              Dev Academy all day errday! 
            </p>
            <h3>Coconut learning tracker</h3>
            <p>
              Maintain accocountability and coconnectivity with myself using coconuts somehow.
            </p>
            <h3>Foundations fellowship and responsiveness</h3>
            <p>
              I want to make an effort to show-up for my crew during my Dev Academy work schedule times, but I'm not sure how to make this a measurable goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              My conduct towards my fellow Foundations and wider DEV Academy crew will be respectful and friendly and honour my core Samoan relationship ethics. I will aim to behave in ways that communicate 'the ancestors within and beyond me recognise the ancestors within and beyond you'.
            </p>
            <h3>Weekly check-ins with Human Skills (Core) facilitators</h3>
            <p>
              Weekly catch up to support my emotional wellbeing throughout Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <h3>End of phase Tech-ins</h3>
            <p>
              At the end of each Phase you will have a Tech-in with my teacher(s). This will be 1:1 time where my teachers will be able to provide  feedback on my technical progress and address any technical concerns I may have.
            </p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Journaling and mindfulness meditation</h3>
            <p>
              I will meditate and journal goal setting and reflections everyday.
