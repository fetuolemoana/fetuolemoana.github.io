        <h2>Imagination and hope</h2>
        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's fluidity; it can form and remove new and old pathways throughout life. Your brain is dynamic; imagining and learning new stuff creates pathways and not learning new stuff can have the opposite effect. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While researching neuroplasticity, I came across an interesting idea called 'neurodecolonization' by Dr Michael Yellow Bird. Bird's research reveals that mindfulness practice can dim the oppressive brain pathways of colonialism. Because of neuroplasticity, we can imagine and create mental pathways that overcome the internalised impacts of colonisation. Recognising the power of imagination on the brain, body and spirit promotes a hopeful outlook and a hopeful outlook promotes affirmative action. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many ways to promote positive neuroplasticity: 
          <ul>
            <li>good quality sleep</li>
            <li>exercise</li>
            <li>reduce stress</li>
            <li>meditate</li>
            <li>learn something new such as how to play an instrument and / or learn a new language (like code!)</li>
          </ul>
          Sleep is particularly important to me personally, as I recognise this as important time for reconnecting with my subconscious and ancestors. Without this time, the realms blur and it becomes impossible to function in either world effectively. 
        </p>
        <p>Regularity is also important to solidify new brain connections being created; having regular coding practice is more beneficial to my learning than pushing all my learning to the weekends. 
        </p>
        <h3>Growth and fixed mindsets</h3>
        <p>
          A valuable lesson for me in the growth and fixed mindset model, is knowing that you are not necessarily 'fixed' to one mode. Recognising that I have a growth mindset when it comes to collective activities, and a slightly more fixed mindset when I am working on my own personal learning has helped me to engage in a new level of awareness about who I am and how I might approach my ongoing personal development.
