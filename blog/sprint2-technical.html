          <h2>Best practices using classes and id</h2>
          <p>
            Cascading style sheets (CSS) lets us apply styles to the content of a webpage and store it all in a CSS document. Before CSS, all the styles instructions had to be included with the HTML file and added to every styled element. Now, we can add a line in an HTML file telling it where to go for the styles instructions. Content goes in the HTML file and styles are organised in the CSS file - nice.   
          </p>  
          <p>
            In CSS, HTML tags (e.g. h1) are used as selectors, and each selector is given a property (e.g. colour), and value for a property (e.g. black) - altogether (h1, colour, black), this gives the selector / element in the HTML file, a style. Note that selectors may be given multiple properties. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Classes and ids are also selectors. Without classes and ids, we would have to put up with only one style being applied to an element. After some reading on classes and ids, it seems that the id selector is like a single fishing hook, and the class selector is like a net.     
          </p>
          <p>
            Interesting info about IDs and classes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each element should only use one id, and each page should have only one element using a particular id. Ids can also be used as page anchors for certain elements, but if an id is used more than once on a page, this feature will not work properly.</li>
            <li>Classes can be used multiple times and multiple classes can be applied to an element.</li>
            <li>Use descriptive names for both classes and ids to improve the structural and semantic comprehension of your code.</li>
          </ul>
