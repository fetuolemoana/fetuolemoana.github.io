          <h6>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h6>
            <p>
              The idea of process over product reminded me to focus on understanding rather than the look of my blog.
            </p>
          <h6>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h6>
            <p>
              Meditation is something I have always wanted to make time for in my life. I was aware of the benefits, but lacked much practice.
            </p>
          <h6>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h6>
            <p>I learnt about mindfulness training two strands, attention and meta-attention. I enjoyed reading about meta-attention as attention to attention itself, self-directed kindness (being a loving grandmother) and the four steps to deal with distraction. I learnt a lot about mindfulness meditation in this chapter and found it easy to understand and can see how simply some of the practices can benefit many aspects of our everyday lives.</p>
          <h6>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h6>
            <p>Imagining that you are your own kind grandmother to achieve self-directed kindness is a great strategy and the four step plan to work with distractions during meditation: 1. Acknowledge; 2. Experience without judging or reacting; 3. If you need to react, continue maintaining mindfulness; 4. Let it go.</p>
