        <h2>Design to web</h2>
        <h3>Responsive websites</h3>
          <p>
            Responsive websites are designed to work on any sized screen and / or window; they are flexible via the use of percentages and not fixed widths. 
            When you resize a window, the website content will adjust (or remove things like large images) to fit without cutting stuff out awkwardly or making things too small to read or interact with. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is important because more people will be able to access a good quality experience of a website and only one website will need to be created, and not multiple ones for different sized devices.
          </p>
        <h3>Mobile first design</h3>
          <p>
            Clarissa Peterson’s presentation on designing responsive websites likens designing for desktop first and then mobile to moving from a large house to a small apartment. There will be ‘boxes’ that just won’t fit in the apartment / mobile screen. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Anything that can be viewed on a smaller screen can be viewed on a larger screen; this is not the case the other way around. Also, mobile use is increasing while desktop use is declining. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Other positive impacts of designing for mobile first includes content becoming more succinct and information better organised.
          </p>
        <h3>Frameworks pros and cons</h3>
          <p>
            Frameworks provide a common website structure so that developers don’t have to repeatedly rewrite code from scratch. This saves a lot of time. However, one of the disadvantages of this is that learners may not learn how to create frameworks at all, which could lead to less depth of understanding of how they work. 
          </p>
        <h3>Using wireframes</h3>
          <p>
            Creating wireframes is part of good design and development process; they are a visual blueprint for a website and focus on site layout, how elements will be organised and navigation. It is used as a visual representation of the design plan and helps us to direct and see where we want to go with the website design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not 100% comfortable with the practice of adjusting columns. Evidently, I ran over time-boxed allocation for adding the wireframe images and so am leaving it. The images are leaking across into the other columns in the row and I haven’t quite worked out how to fix this efficiently.
