          The Dev Academy experience is presented as an immersive and supportive one that values diversity and inclusivity. 
          Living within a context of capitalism and colonialism means that these values have a high price; time is money and in the words of Ladi6, 'time is not much'.

          It's been over a year since I could afford to return to the phase-0 mahi (after dropping out due to financial stress) and be in a super privileged position to take time from work and apply for the $10,000 Digital Moana scholarship to pay my tuition fees.

          Last week I attended a talanoa session for Maori in Tech featuring Maruhaeremuri Nihoniho, founder and managing director of game development company Metia Interactive. 
          This event was organised by Dev Academy and the way that it was hosted with great care and held with alofa by Dougal and team, was encouraging and reminded me of why I had chosen to learn here.

          Greater dialogue representing peoples of Te Moana Nui a Kiwa (Oceania) harnessing indigenous science in their digital practice and creativity is awe-inspiring and motivating.

          It’s been a long time coming for me to push the va’a out on this journey and I am both excited and nervous to be here.
