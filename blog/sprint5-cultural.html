        <h2>Foundation core skills reflections</h2>
        <h3>The impact of the core learning on my Foundations learning journey</h3> 
        <p>
          What surprised me most about my Foundations core learning journey is the practical experience of the idea that personal development is an infinite project. 
        </p>
        <h3>Three things I have learnt about myself as a result of core learning</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>I am a worthy project, and so is everyone else.</li>
          <li>Consistency and calm is the coconut.</li>
          <li>Vulnerability and courageous authenticity is key to me switching from living as surviving vs thriving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          One of the most challenging aspects of the core learning was practicing prioritising my learning and trying to establish consistent self care while dealing with shades of self doubt. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It was also difficult when I got behind in tech, to then feel ready to tackle core from a strengths-based growth perspective. Having a supportive facilitator / mentor who works from a growth mindset by praising a solid process helps me perservere.
