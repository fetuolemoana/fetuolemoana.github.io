    <h1>Udacity Reflection II</h1>
    <p>Udacity HTML and CSS Lesson 3 covered the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grid-based design</li>
      <li>Building and applying a framework</li>
      <li>Responsive web pages</li>
      <li>Semantic structure</li>
      <li>Refinement</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design and responsiveness</h2>
    <p>Grid-based design is a structural guide for web page layout that is made up of rows and columns. Understanding the way a page is divided into grids will help you build a framework; a collection of classes that will make page layout easier to implement!</p>
    <p>You can have all the grids of a quad book, but they are not much use if people cannot view what you create on their device. Believing the hype on responsive design means acknowledging that people access information via a diverse range of devices. The Udacity lesson offers some suggestions to make a web page responsive:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using percentages instead of fixed pixels to define column size</li>
      <li>Adding flexible box styles and overflow function</li>
      <li>Add media specific css ie @media to change css properties depending on device screen</li>
      <li>CSS resetting using normalize.css</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Applying the framework</h2>
    <p>Semantic structure consists of semantic tags. 'Semantic' tags give meaning to web page content that both computer and humans understand. The semantic structure enables humans to understand the meaning of the content and structure. For example, nav and span tags offer no semantic meaning to content. However, the following semantic tags add structural meaning (semantics):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>h1, h2, h3, h4...</li>
      <li>img</li>
      <li>form</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Udacity lesson ended with fine tuning methods and also continous improvement tips. I appreciated the placeholder images and Google Fonts tips. The cycle of code, test, refine is a great image to keep in mind when building web pages.</p>
