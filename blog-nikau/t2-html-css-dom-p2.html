    <h3>Udacity HTML and CSS lessons</h3>
    <p>The Udacity HTML and CSS lessons covered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>grid-based design</li>
        <li>building and applying frameworks such as Bootstrap</li>
        <li>responsive web pages</li>
        <li>semantic structure</li>
        <li>refinement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Grid-based design refers to a structure for web page layouts made up of rows and columns.</p>
    <p>Understanding the way a page is divided into grids will help you build a framework; a collection of classes that will make page layouts easier to implement.</p>
    <h4>Believing the hype on responsive design</h4>
    <p>Recognising that people access information via a range of different devices is more than hype, it's smart.</p>
    <p>Implementing practices that create more responsive web pages is even smarter. The Udacity lessons offer suggestions to make a web page responsive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>using percentages instead of fixed pixels to define column size</li>
        <li>adding flexible box styles and overflow</li>
        <li>add media specific css e.g. @media to change css properties depending on device screen size</li>
        <li>and CSS resetting using mormalize.css.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Applying the framework</h4>
    <p>Semantic structure consists of semantic tags. Semantic tags give meaning to web page content that both computers and humans understand.</p>
    <p>The semantic structure enables humans to understand the meaning of the content and structure For example, nav and span tags offer no semantic meaning to content. However, the following semantic tags add structural meaning (semantics):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>heading - h1, h2, h3, h4...</li>
        <li>image - img</li>
        <li>a form - form</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The lessons demonstrated fine tuning methods (i.e. code, test, refine), continuos improvement tips and links to tools such as Google Fonts, placeholder text sites and Bootstrap.</p>
    <p>The additional lesson covering Bootstrap helped to reinforce how divs, rows, columns and classes can work.</p>
