        <h2>Meditation process</h2>
        <h3>'Process over product' concept</h3>
          <p>
            The idea of process over product reminded me to focus on understanding rather than the look of my blog. However, it is difficult to move on and leave things that don't appear as expected. When I don't timebox clearly I can get lost in trying to fix little annoying things. 
          </p>
        <h3>Search Inside Yourself chapter 2 on meditation</h3>
          <p>
            Meditation is something I have always wanted to make time for in my life. I was aware of the benefits, but lacked practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learnt about mindfulness training two strands, attention and meta-attention. I enjoyed reading about meta-attention as attention to attention itself, self-directed kindness (being a loving grandmother) and the four steps to deal with distraction. I learnt a lot about mindfulness meditation in this chapter and found it easy to understand and can see how simply some of the practices can benefit many aspects of our everyday lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagining that you are your own kind grandmother to achieve self-directed kindness is a great strategy and the four step plan to work with distractions during meditation: 1. Acknowledge; 2. Experience without judging or reacting; 3. If you need to react, continue maintaining mindfulness; 4. Let it go.
