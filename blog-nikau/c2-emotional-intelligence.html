  <h3>Search Inside Yourself</h3>
  <p>The first chapter of Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan offered insight about mindfulness and emotional intelligence.</p>
  <p>Mindfulness is defined as 'moment to moment non-judgemental awareness' and / or 'bicep curls for the brain'.</p>
  <p>Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as a 'collection of emotional skills'.</p>
  <p>You can build your EI by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>attention training e.g. two minutes of mindfulness</li>
    <li>self-knowledge and mastery e.g. understanding the differences between existential, experiential and physiological selfhood</li>
    <li>creating kind mental habits e.g. wishing happiness for every person you meet.</li>
  </ul>
