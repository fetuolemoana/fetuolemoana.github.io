    <h3>Analogy: Building an umu</h3>
    <p>
        To build an umu you need stones, wood, coconut shells and husk. The wood and kindling husk is set alight and the stones become hot and food is then placed on top of the stones and covered with leaves. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Baskets are woven and when they are complete, the food should be cooked. Food is placed with care in the baskets and distributed to neighbouring families in the village.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is like the items needed to cook the food; the wood, stones, coconut shells and husk. It acts as a foundation of the whole website 'cooking' process. Without this foundation, you will not be able to cook any delicious food.</li>
        <li>CSS is like the food placed and cooked on top of the umu foundation which then becomes yummy and flavourful. If the food is not stacked with care on top of the stones and in the correct order, the food may be undercooked or burnt.</li>
        <li>DOM is like the process of weaving and placing food in baskets and sharing it. This process is like the representation or 'interface' of the relationship you have with your fellow vilagers.</li>
    </ul>
