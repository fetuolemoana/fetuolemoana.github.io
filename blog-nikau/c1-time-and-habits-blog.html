    <h3>time and habits</h3>
    <p>The timebox and habits techniques I found interesting were the pomodoro technique, Fogg method and the 'counterintuitive' ways to be productive list.</p>
    <p>I have been using the pomodoro technique and found that helped me focus on the completion of specific tasks.</p> 
    <p>I would like to create an action plan on how I can incorporate the pomodoro technique, Fogg method and counterintuitive ways into how I manage catching up ahead of bootcamp.</p>
