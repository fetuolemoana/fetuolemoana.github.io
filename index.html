  <h3>A note on fiabotzolemoana and umu</h3>

  <ul class="secondary">
    <li>fiabotz: colloquialism for the word fiapoto (Sāmoa). 'Fia' as in 'to want', and 'poto' as in intelligence or smarts. Generally used by some Pasifika peoples living in Aotearoa to describe a 'know it all'.</li>
    <li>olemoana: 'o le' as in 'of the', and 'moana' as in sea or ocean.</li>
    <li>umu: earth and stone oven. The process of preparing an umu and cooking food in this manner is a collective practice in Sāmoa and other islands of Oceania.</li>
    <li>also bot (short for "robot"): Wikipedia says 'typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone' #goals</li>
